Summary of Work Performed

Based on the analysis of 61 commits over the last 30 days, the work can be characterized by three primary themes: deep
architectural refactoring of the core order processing workflow, significant feature enhancement related to shipping and
product data, and the meta-task of building the analysis tool itself. The activity shows a pattern of intense, focused work
sessions, often involving large-scale changes across multiple files.

Key Achievements & Areas of Focus

1. Core Workflow Modernization & Refactoring:
    * A substantial effort was dedicated to modernizing the backend, particularly migrating from Zod and monolithic constructs
        to Effect Schema. This is a significant architectural shift aimed at improving data validation, error handling, and type
        safety (Commits 16aa3ed, 69393ba).
    * The main Step Function was heavily refactored by extracting logic into modular, single-responsibility constructs like
        StarshipitWorkflow, EzeepWorkflow, ValidationWorkflow, and ShopifyUpdateWorkflow. This indicates a major push towards a
        more maintainable and resilient architecture (Commits 69b9abe, 9f901f6).
    * Build and development tooling also saw significant improvements, with a large migration of scripts into a central
        Makefile and updates to the ESLint configuration (Commits efeec96, ad34cb8).

2. Enhancement of Shipping & Product Logistics:
    * There was a heavy focus on the Starshipit integration, including improving order discovery, enhancing resilience, and
        adding support for customs documentation for foreign orders (Commits 6c89921, af1c182, 07218d6).
    * Parcel determination logic was a key area of work, evolving to include bin-packing algorithms, dynamic packing diagrams,
        and better handling of product dimensions and HS codes (Commits b22cd24, 896a4a7).
    * Product data handling was made more robust by loading data from S3 instead of local CSVs and implementing scripts to
        bulk-update Shopify data like HS codes (Commits ebd7246, fe3c453).

3. Meta-Work: Building the Analysis Tool:
    * A notable portion of the work involved creating and iteratively refining the very tool used to generate this analysis.
        This began with simple commit analysis and evolved into a sophisticated tool with a dynamic decay model for hour
        estimation, file-based statistics, and CLI arguments. This demonstrates a strong commitment to data-driven
        self-improvement and process optimization.

Patterns of Activity

The work pattern is characterized by bursts of high-intensity development. For example, the sessions on Sep 25-27 show a rapid
succession of feature enhancements and refactoring related to parcel determination, product data, and order processing. The
large number of files and lines changed in commits like ad34cb8 (ESLint config) and e63f542 (test order creation) suggest that
when a task is undertaken, it involves deep, systemic changes rather than superficial edits. The use of plan.md and task.md
(visible in diffs) points to a structured approach to tackling complex issues.

Overall, the 30-day period reflects a mature development process focused on not just adding features, but on fundamentally
improving the reliability, maintainability, and architectural integrity of the entire system.
